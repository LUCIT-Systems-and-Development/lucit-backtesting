    "_Backtesting.py_ Quick Start User Guide\n",
    "=======================\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows some of the features of *backtesting.py*, a Python framework for [backtesting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp) trading strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Backtesting.py_ is a small and lightweight, blazing fast backtesting framework that uses state-of-the-art Python structures and procedures (Python 3.6+, Pandas, NumPy, Bokeh). It has a very small and simple API that is easy to remember and quickly shape towards meaningful results. The library _doesn't_ really support stock picking or trading strategies that rely on arbitrage or multi-asset portfolio rebalancing; instead, it works with an individual tradeable asset at a time and is best suited for optimizing position entrance and exit signal strategies, decisions upon values of technical indicators, and it's also a versatile interactive trade visualization and statistics tool.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "_You bring your own data._ Backtesting ingests _all kinds of \n",
    "[OHLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-high-low-close_chart)\n",

    "with columns `'Open'`, `'High'`, `'Low'`, `'Close'` and (optionally) `'Volume'`.\n",
    "Such data is widely obtainable, e.g. with packages:\n",
    "* [pandas-datareader](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),\n",
    "* [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/tools/python),\n",

    "* [investpy](https://investpy.readthedocs.io/),\n",
    "  etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these columns, **your data frames can have additional columns which are accessible in your strategies in a similar manner**.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrame should ideally be indexed with a _datetime index_ (convert it with [`pd.to_datetime()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.to_datetime.html));\n",
    "otherwise a simple range index will do."
